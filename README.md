# Repository Description

The goal of this repository is to make the code examples, written in the programming
tutorials, achievable and downloadable by others. The repository can also be used
by others for educational purposes or as an example to the tasks, that may be
used while teaching.

# Repository Structure

Here is an overview of the exercises by topics:

| Topics                | Tutorial Nr. | Exercises  |
|-----------------------|--------------|------------|
| Main                  | T1           | T1.DEMO    |
| OOP                   | T1           | T1.1, T1.2 |
| Data Types            | T1, T2       | T2.1       |
| Control Structures    | T2           | T2.2, T2.3 |
| Scanner               | T3           | T3.1       |
| Methods & Overloading | T3           | T3.2       |
| Constructors          | T3           | T3.2       |

## Tutorial 1

First tutorial was an introduction to java. 

Topics discussed:
- Main Program
- Objects & Classes (OOP)
- Data Types

### Demo
This is a demo program of how the `main` methods are used and which
commands are required for running an example program.

### Exercise 1
This exercise is beginner-friendly. It uses the basics of OOP concept
& a couple of data types.

### Exercise 2
This one was a bit more challenging task. Which requires a better
understanding of the OOP concept. This task also demonstrates
how a game could be written in an OOP environment.

## Tutorial 2

Started diving into general java structure.

Topics discussed:
- Data Types
- `If` Statements
- `Switch` Cases
- `For` Loops
- `While` Loops
- `do-While` Loops

### Exercise 1
A short code inspection task. It requires deeper knowledge on how
some data type operators function. 

### Exercise 2
This task is again beginner-friendly and requires only fair bit of knowledge on
differences between loop types.

### Exercise 3
This task requires understanding how the control structures can be used
together and how they will be implemented in real life situations.

## Tutorial 3

Talked about `Java.util.Scanner` inputs and how methods in java work.

Topics discussed:
- `instanceof` & type casting
- `Scanner`
- Methods
- Method Overloading
- Constructors
- Static Methods
- JavaDocs

### Exercise 1
A homework-similar task on how to work with `Scanner`. Creating a command-input
structure that is later on used in various programs for I/O.

### Exercise 2
A general modelling task for practicing method implementations and
method overloading. This task also contains a basic OOP implementation.
