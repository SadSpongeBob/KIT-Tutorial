# Repository Description

The goal of this repository is to make the code examples, written in the programming
tutorials, achievable and downloadable by others. The repository can also be used
by others for educational purposes or as an example to the tasks, that may be
used while teaching.

# Repository Structure

## Tutorial 1

First tutorial was an introduction to java. The following topics were discussed:
- Main Program
- Objects & Classes (OOP)
- Data Types

### Demo
This is a demo program of how the `main` methods are used and which
commands are required for running an example program.

### Exercise 1
This exercise is beginner-friendly. It uses the basics of OOP concept
& a couple of data types.

### Exercise 2
This one was a bit more challenging task. Which requires a better
understanding of the OOP concept. This task also demonstrates
how a game could be written in an OOP environment.
